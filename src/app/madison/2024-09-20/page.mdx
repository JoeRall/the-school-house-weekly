**Dear Primary lII Families,**

Happy Friday! Our learners continued their engaging lesson on the community, and we can't wait to share their progress with you. This week was exceptionally beautiful, allowing us to spend ample time outside in our delightful outdoor classroom. Together, we planted Montauk daisies and a variety of other bulbs, eagerly anticipating their blooms in the spring.

We were also thrilled to kick off our specials this week. The Learners had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Elizabeth, our dynamic Spanish Educator; Ms. Gabby, our marvelous Music Educator; Ms. Dani, our inspiring Art Educator; and Ms. Olivia, our enthusiastic librarian. The Learners excitedly borrowed library books to enjoy at home and had an absolute blast with Ms. Gabby during their music sessions.

**Memorable Moments**

As part of our AEC curriculum, we continued our exploration of the concept of community. We began the week focusing on "You, the Person," and read the delightful book "I Like Me!" by Nancy Carlson. This engaging story encouraged our Learners to appreciate their unique qualities. We then looked into mirrors, where each child observed themselves, identifying characteristics such as hair or eye color that make them special.

On Monday, we took a walk around campus to collect natural materials. These outdoor elements were used to create unique portraits, helping the children connect with their surroundings and further understand their school community.

On Tuesday, our theme was "Your Family as a Community." We hosted a Socratic discussion in which Learners shared their family's favorite activities. This heartfelt exchange highlighted the importance of families and emphasized that they are our first community. Keira mentioned that she enjoys spending time with her nana while watching their favorite show. Bowie shared how she loves going to the beach with her brothers and parents. Theo expressed his love for his mother's cooking. In the afternoon, we created a book about each Learner and their families.

On Wednesday, we began our lesson by reading "Our School as a Community," a book that highlights the essential members of The School House who contribute to its smooth operation. This allows us to come here each day to learn and thrive together as a community. We delved deeper into the concept of what makes a community, understanding the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved, from Educators and staff to Learners and parents. This exploration helped us appreciate the collective effort required to create a nurturing and effective educational environment.

Thursday’s lesson focused on "Your American Community." We began by showing a map of the United States and identifying where each family lives. We discussed what it means to be part of the larger American community, exploring aspects such as where we sleep, eat, and go to school. We delved into what Americans enjoy in their homes and which plants grow here. The children read a book about America and created a chart with tiny drawings depicting the foods they eat in America. This chart will be continually updated throughout the year as we explore other communities around the world.

We culminated the week with a creative project—making a beautiful American flag out of cloth. Each Learner proudly contributed to this collaborative artwork, which now hangs in our classroom as a symbol of their hard work and patriotism. We also discussed the story of Betsy Ross and how she used beautiful materials to craft the flag that inspired "The Star-Spangled Banner." Our conversation underscored why flags are significant representations of community and identity.

This flag will remain framed in our classroom for all to see, serving as a constant reminder of our shared learning journey.
