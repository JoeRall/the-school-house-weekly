**Dear TSH Families,**

Happy Friday! We had another fantastic week in the Library.

In Primary, we had an epic Storytime outside that elevated this week’s lessons on Explorers. I read "Ahoy!", an immersive story by Sophie Blackall, where a child-captain and parent first-mate embarked on a journey through the high seas, all without leaving their living room! It was full of humor, cooperation, creativity, as well as new words such as “land ho!” and “hoist the burgee, sailors!”

Following the story, we extended our new understanding by making our own burgee! This is a type of flag used to identify a ship and has two forks at the end, differentiating it from a typical flag or pennant. Each Primary class was given a cut out of a burgee with one symbol on each; PIII had **T**, PII had **S**, and PI had **H**. A few Learners at a time worked together using the watercolor palette to beautifully decorate the burgee. Once everyone had their turn, we went searching as a crew of Explorers to find the perfect stick to hold up the burgee. Primary Explorers were triumphant in their search!

In Elementary I, we continued our study on Fiction and Non-Fiction. Learners gathered in a Circle and recalled the defining characteristics of each genre. Then I presented two books: "The Life Cycle of a Frog", and "Frog and Toad All Year." I started by asking the Learners, what is something similar between these two? What do you think, based on the cover, is Fiction and Non-Fiction? It was so rewarding to see how well the Learners remembered last week’s introduction to the material and how they used it to support their ideas. Next, I had a volunteer read a few pages from both books and paused after to ask more questions; what are we learning? Is this book giving us facts or an entertaining story? Then we broke off into two groups to play a game. Group Fiction and Group Non-Fiction had small bundles of characteristics such as Maps, Characters, Diagrams, Illustrations, Index/Glossary, Beginning/Middle/End, etc. They worked together to figure out which characteristic would classify under their group and presented the finished pile once the time was up. I was so proud of how well they retained their knowledge and used it in a timely manner. Afterwards, Learners were welcome to check out any book to finish off our time in Library Workshop!

A huge thank you to everyone who has helped their Learner return their books from last year. I sincerely appreciate it!

And we’re off! Learners communicate with each other to classify the elements of Fiction and Non-Fiction.

This week’s Spotlight is on Bowie Searles! Bowie is a kind, creative and free-spirited Kindergartener in Primary III. She is always happy to participate and lend a helping hand whenever needed. Her enthusiasm for Storytimes, crafts, and books is contagious. Bowie shines her light everywhere she goes, and I’m so grateful to have a Learner like her in the Library! Way to go, Bowie!

**Looking Ahead**

In Primary, we will continue our Storytime and of course, checking out some more books! Now that we are in the full swing of things, our readings will be closely focusing on what the Learners learn each week, as per the curriculum. We are so excited to expand our knowledge through special stories!

In Elementary, we will continue to dissect the functionality of the Library; what makes a book Fiction or Nonfiction? How do we classify books? What is library literacy and why is it important? How do we properly use a book’s index? Gradually, Learners will learn more about how and why the Library is a fantastic resource as an extension of their classroom and how we can utilize this knowledge for our benefit. I’m eager to see in what areas of the Library will the Learners choose to inaugurate what they learn in their classrooms, whether it’s through research, reading and/or writing!

**Questions to Ask & Parent Conversations**

Some questions to ask Learners at the dinner table, during the course of next week:

Primary -

-   What does “make haste” mean?
-   What did the vacuum from the story turn into?
-   What would your Captain name be? What would your ship’s name be?

Elementary -

-   How do we organize Fiction books in the Library?
-   What is the name of the part of a book that has the title, holds all the pages together, and has a label and sticker to show where it belongs?
-   What is personification? In what ways were Frog and Toad personified in the story?
**Warmly,**
