**Dear Primary lll Families,**

Happy Friday! We hope you had a wonderful week! Can you believe that Fall is already here? We are enjoying every last minute of the warm weather. Our Learners are keeping busy in our Backyard.

**Memorable Moments**

This week as part of the AEC, we learned about Exploration. We started off the week asking our Learners what exploration is.  Theo said “it is when you go to new places.” Exploration is the act of traveling to new places to learn about them. Our Learners enjoyed hearing stories about many brave explorers who traveled on land and water. Some people explored air and space! Some of these explorers lived long, long ago. We learned about Daniel Boone who lived long ago. He was a land explorer who traveled west of the Appalachian Mountains. Francis Cozier explored the ocean and mapped the Antarctic. Neil Armstrong traveled through space to explore the moon.

Theo, Emma, and Bowie are looking at the photos of famous explorers.

After learning about some of the many brave explorers, we asked our Learners if they would like to be explorers. Jonathan said he would like to explore frogs. Kennedy told us that she wants to explore the sky to find unicorns. We talked about some of the important qualities that explorers possess. Explorers are curious. Keira said “explorers wonder about things.” They are eager to learn about new places. Explorers carefully observe their surroundings to take in information. Explorers must be good at solving problems during their journeys. Explorers also need tools to help with their journey. Our Learners know that you need a boat to explore the ocean. We need a rocket to explore space. Common tools that are needed by explorers include maps, compasses, and binoculars. Our Learners enjoyed taking turns using all three of these tools.

Theo is using the compass.

Our Learners love using magnets, so the compass was particularly interesting to them. We learned that a compass relies on the Earth’s natural magnetic field causing the needle of a compass to point North-South. We asked our Learners if they thought we could make a compass. Our Learners were eager to try. First we filled a bowl with water. Next we placed a thin piece of cork on the water. Our Learners love exploring items to see if they sink or float. They noticed that cork floats! Then we rubbed a needle on a magnet. This helped the needle to become magnetic. Finally we placed the needle on the cork. We were delighted to see the needle turn to face North-South, just like a compass.

The needle pointed North-South.

We know that explorers travel by land, air, and sea. How did people explore the land before cars were invented? Could you travel across the ocean with a boat? Our Learners enjoyed a lesson on classifying objects based on land, air, and water.

Theo is classifying the objects.

Maps are used not only to explore far away places, they also can help us explore our immediate surroundings. Our Learners enjoyed reading the story Me on the Map, by Joan Sweeney. This playful story is a fun introduction to the concepts of maps. To further learn about where we live and how we fit into the larger world, we used our Pink Tower to help us understand our cosmic address. The largest block represented Our Galaxy. As we built the tower, the blocks became smaller and smaller, representing the Universe/Milky Way, Solar System, Earth, North America, United States of America, New York, East Northport, The School House, and finally Primary lll. Bowie knew that we live in the state of New York.

Our complete Cosmic Address.

Does exploration only occur when we travel far away? Of course not. Our Learners took some time to explore our Outdoor Classroom. They enjoyed making their own maps of this area.

Bowie and Madison are working on their maps.

Our Learners enjoyed exploring the different kinds of maps. Road maps show us routes of travel. Physical maps show us boundaries of states, countries, etc. Topographic maps show us natural features such as mountains, lakes, and rivers. They also show us manmade features such as roads, train tracks and buildings. Our Learners enjoyed using our Land and Water Form work to compare the concepts such as island and lake, cape and bay, and isthmus and strait. They also used watercolors to create their own maps of some of these features.

To review all that we have learned throughout the week, our Learners enjoyed participating in a True or False activity during our Circle Time lesson.

This week our Shout Out goes to Kennedy. You wouldn’t know that Kennedy is a First Year Learner. The way she chooses work and navigates the classroom with poise and ease is remarkable! Kennedy is a kind Learner and we are so happy to have her in Primary lll.
