**Dear Primary I Parents,**

We had such an incredible first full week of school, and we’re so excited to tell you all about it. We also want to thank you all for attending our Parent Orientation last night. It was so enjoyable for us to connect with you and give you a peek into what your child is working on when they come to school every day.

We began our week on Monday with our 2nd Year Primary Learners joining our class and getting right into the rhythm of the work cycle. Just like last week, Learners were so eager to return to their favorite materials and receive lessons with new work on the shelves. Once everyone arrived, we gathered in Circle for our first group lesson. Because we had some new faces joining us, we began our Circle by practicing how to greet a new friend. As with all Grace and Courtesy lessons, the Educators model skills first and then invite Learners to practice. This way, when Learners encounter these situations during their day, they have already practiced the skills they will need. To begin, Ms. Kaitlyn asked for a volunteer to help her, and Leo Tuccio raised his hand. Together, Ms. Kaitlyn and Leo modeled saying, “Hi, my name is Ms. Kaitlyn. What is your name?” Then, “My name is Leo. It’s nice to meet you.” We finished with, “It’s nice to meet you too!” Next, many Learners came up to practice their greeting skills in pairs. It was so sweet to watch everyone smiling and warming up to each other! Following this, we transitioned to talking about our topic of the week - our classroom community. To introduce this, we read the book Our Class is a Family by Shannon Olsen. This book helps show the similarities of a family living together in a home and the family that we are together in the classroom. We all care for each other, we all help each other, and we create a cozy, safe environment just like a home. We talked about how it’s ok to make mistakes, and how if someone is having a tough day, we are all there for that person. Ultimately, we are all here to help each other learn and grow.

Our morning on Tuesday began with another important Grace and Courtesy lesson - how to ask a friend to play at recess. For this lesson, we practiced two different scenarios. First, we acted out asking to join a group. We talked about how when you are playing in a group and someone asks to play, it is usually kind to say “sure!” Learners took turns both asking to join the group by saying “Can I play with you?” as well as being the group members who accepted the request by saying, “Sure!” Next, we talked about how if someone is playing by themselves, they might not want to play with anyone else - and that’s ok. To rehearse this scenario, Ms. Kaitlyn pretended to be playing in the sandbox by herself. When John modeled coming up and asking if he could play, Ms. Kaitlyn modeled saying, “I’m playing by myself right now, but maybe later!” in a kind tone. Following this, Learners took turns practicing this scenario as well.

Next, we brought our conversation back to the topic of our classroom community and discussed one of the most important elements - working together as a team. To demonstrate this, we used the book That Fruit is Mine! by Anuska Allepuz. This silly book tells the story about 5 elephants who desire a new, exotic fruit at the tippy top of a tree in their forest. They all take turns trying to get to the fruit first, often shouting, “It’s mine!” As the elephants are failing to reach the fruit, a tiny group of mice work as a team to climb the tree and retrieve it. In the end, the elephants learn that if they work as a team, they can reach endless fruit on the tree and enjoy it all together. This book was the perfect way for us to illustrate how much more effective it is to work together to accomplish our classroom goals.

We were so excited to have the rest of our Primary Learners join us on Wednesday! The classroom was abuzz with Learners exploring the shelves, receiving lessons on new activities, and warming up to the morning work cycle process. Once we gathered in Circle, we read a crowd favorite - Bear Feels Sick by Karma Wilson. Before beginning the book, some of our older Learners explained to our new Learners what a community is - a group of people working together. Ms. Kaitlyn then asked everyone to be on the lookout for examples of community in the story as she read. This book tells the tale of a bear who falls ill and his group of animal friends that come together to take care of him. They all fulfill different roles - Badger fetched the water, the Hare and the Mole made soup, the Raven gathered herbs to make tea, the Mouse held an ice pack on the bear’s head, the Owl painted pictures to decorate the bear’s den, and the bird sang a lullaby to help the bear sleep. As a class, we talked about how the animals were their own small “community” or team coming together for a common purpose - with each animal contributing what they were best at.

Next, we introduced the 3 School Rules that we have at TSH: take care of your school, take care of each other, and take care of yourself. Together, we brainstormed examples of what each rule might look like. For “take care of your school,” Learners raised their hands to talk about using our materials the right way, putting things back where we found them, and cleaning up any messes we might make during the day. While discussing how we can “take care of each other,” Learners shared examples like helping a friend feel better if they look sad, and speaking in a kind voice to each other. Finally, when we talked about how we can “take care of yourself,” we discussed being gentle with yourself if you make a mistake, taking care of your own heart, and making sure you get ready for school every day. This conversation was an excellent review for our older Learners and the perfect introduction to our newer Learners about the expectations we have here at TSH.

In the afternoon, we participated in a fun group activity that helped show how we are all connected. Ms. Kaitlyn began by asking the question, “who likes macaroni and cheese?” Several hands went up and she chose Leo to link arms with her. Next she asked, “Who likes to go swimming?” After several Learners raised their hands again, Ms. Kaitlyn chose Ariella to link arms on the other side. Ms. Kaitlyn then guided both Leo and Ariella to ask “Who likes…?” questions, helping us discover similarities and common interests between us. By the end of the exercise, we were all linked together in one large group - and although we are all different, we are also all connected as one community. Ms. Kaitlyn then demonstrated how the energy of one person in the group can affect the other members by “dragging” her body down and causing the others around her to stumble a bit. Alternatively, if one person in the group is smiling and extending kindness, the others can feel it and it brings the energy of the group up.

While Wednesday was a discussion about our school rules, on Thursday we zoomed into our classroom community and decided on our Primary 1 Classroom rules together. Because we are all members of the classroom, it was important that we come together and discuss what we think our rules should be. To introduce this, we looked at a copy of the Magna Carta. We learned that this was a document created in England because the King had too much power. To remedy this, the Magna Carta was created to establish the rights of the people. Our discussion opened with a simple question: “What should our classroom rules be?” Instantly hands went up and Learners began to share their thoughts on this question. Ariella told us that we need to “be safe.” Riley offered that we need to “walk in the classroom.” John shared that we need to “speak kindly to each other.” Leo noted that “we don’t interrupt our friends when they are working.” This one was SO important that we paused for a Grace and Courtesy lesson where we practiced wanting to go up to our friend to tell them something, seeing them engaged in their work, and deciding to turn around and hold it in our minds for later to tell them. Overall, we were so impressed to see the Learners coming together and brainstorming an amazing list of classroom agreements. In the end, these are the classroom agreements we decided upon:

We walk in the classroom.

We move gently.

We are safe.

We are first time listeners.

We are gentle with our materials.

We speak in a kind and soft voice.

We use one voice at a time.

We use our Circle manners.

We are kind to everyone.

We let our friends focus on their work.

We tied them all together in one easy way to remember it all:

Be safe, be gentle, be kind.

Next week, we will transform our Classroom Agreement into a beautiful piece of art so we can remember what we have all agreed to.

Our afternoon continued with a fun lesson on communication. Each Learner received a colorful dot sticker on their face, but they couldn’t see what the color was. Learners had to communicate with each other, asking questions like “What color is my sticker?” and figure out how to separate themselves into groups based on their color. It was such a fun activity that highlighted the importance of clear communication - and we had plenty of laughs along the way!

On Friday, our week tied up with the book Collaboration Station by Shannon Olsen. This book talks about how effective and efficient it is to work as a team, and even introduces concepts like compromise, problem solving, and the importance of Leaders. It was the perfect way to bring all of our lessons on community together. Next, we finished with a favorite - The Stick Bundle! First, each Learner and Educator received one stick to hold. Ms. Kaitlyn held her stick and showed everyone what would happen if she tried to take on the responsibilities of taking care of the classroom and each other all on her own..she would “crack” just like the stick, because it’s too much for one person. Next, she gathered everyone’s stick together and showed what happens when we all come together, working as a team…we become one strong, united bundle that is impossible to break!

This week we are delighted to feature John. John is a second year Primary Learner with a kind spirit and warm smile. He was so motivated to return to the classroom and get right back to his favorite materials! One of the benefits of our combined age classrooms is that Learners get inspired by seeing their friends challenging themselves with new work. John witnessed a friend excitedly working with the Movable Alphabet this week and asked for a lesson himself! On only his first time working with this material, John filled up his entire rug with words! The pride on his face when he stepped back and saw all of the words he had written was so heartwarming for us to see. He then proceeded to record the words he had written on his rug onto paper so he could take it home. John also received a lesson on the 100 Board this week. With this material, John successfully put numbers 1 - 100 into order. It was a big work and it took lots of time and perseverance to finish - John looked so accomplished when he was done and even took it out the next day to repeat the whole process.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week, we will be zooming out and looking at the larger community around us. We will look at “you the person,” as well as our School community and our American community.

**Questions to Ask & Parent Conversations**

-   What are the 3 School Rules at TSH?
-   How do you take care of your classroom?
-   How can you ask a friend to play at recess or outside?
-   What does it mean to be a first time listener?
