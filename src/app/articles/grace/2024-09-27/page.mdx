**Dear Primary I Parents,**

Happy Friday and happy fall! Our Learners were so excited to finally change the season on our Classroom Calendar!

We had a very productive and exciting week in PI! To start the week off, we spoke about European Explorers, but before we dove into our unit of explorers the Learners were asked, “what does it mean to be an explorer?” Leo mentioned that they can be people who explore nature and John added they can be people who explore forests too. Those are excellent examples! Together, we concurred that an explorer is someone who goes on adventures to

unfamiliar places to discover new things!

Next, the Learners were asked, “where are some places you could go and explore?” Jayden said space, to which Owen replied that astronauts are the explorers of space. That’s right! Many Learners also exclaimed “Disney World” is a place of exploration! These were all fantastic examples of places you can explore! It was lovely to watch the Learners engage and participate in our Socratic Circle discussion.

After this brief conversation, the Learners got to see photographs of some of the most famous explorers throughout history. They loved seeing the explorer who discovered the United States of America, Christopher Columbus, as well as Leif Erikson who was a brave Viking who sailed across the ocean to find new lands long ago.

We of course had to include some of the most famous female explorers throughout history such as Isabella Bird, who was a brave woman that loved to explore the world. She traveled to many places that were wild and beautiful, like the mountains of Colorado and the islands of Hawaii. The Learners loved learning about Amelia Earhart who was a courageous and adventurous pilot who made history by being the first woman to fly alone across the Atlantic Ocean. She loved flying from a young age and worked hard to learn how to fly airplanes. Her courage and determination inspired many people, especially women, to follow their dreams and believe they could do anything. Amelia Earhart is remembered as a pioneer in aviation, showing that with hard work and bravery, anything is possible!

Riley is looking at a photograph of Isabella Bird and Vincent is looking at a photograph of Leif Erikson!

Following our discussion about Amelia Earnhart, we read the book I am Ameila Earmhart by Brad Meltzer. This story dives into the exciting life of Amelia Earhart who was a young girl with a passion for adventure. She never allowed anyone to hold her back from exploring new opportunities. She even took on challenges that girls had never attempted before, such as flying across the Atlantic Ocean all by herself. Amelia always pursued her dreams with determination. She set flying records and showed the world that women can achieve just as much as men, and with hard work and dedication you can achieve anything you put your mind to! The Learners adored this book.

To end our Socratic Circle discussion each Learner shared where they would want to travel and explore. Jax told us he wants to explore the water, Maggie said she wants to explore Aruba, Leo and Ariella want to explore Italy, and Zachary and Jayden want to explore the mountains and space together! Collins, Riley and Kira also shared that they want to explore their homes, and backyards and Skylar said she’d love to explore the trail in her backyard too! Jayson told us he wants to explore everything! The Learners loved sharing and are so inspired by the explorers we spoke about, and they hope to explore many places around them too!

Owen and Kira make their sailboats!

After reading the story, Otto’s Today is Columbus Day! Our Learners gained a better understanding of the reasons behind Columbus Day. Our Learners joined Otto, the bulldog and his friend Dennis on a journey back to 1492 when Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Through this story, our Learners got to experience the adventure alongside Columbus! They learned how curiosity, determination, and perseverance played vital roles in shaping America.

After learning more about Christoper Columbus and his voyage through the Atlantic Ocean on the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria, our Learners got to create their own sailboats. They crumbled tissue paper for the ocean and clouds and they used cardstock for their sails. They loved making their sailboats colorful and unique, and they wished they could make three just like Christopher Columbus had!

Kira, Owen, Zacahary and John made beautiful compass roses!

To conclude this week, our learners were asked if they knew what a compass rose was. John said “it’s something that shows you where to go!” which is exactly right! It is a tool explorers use that shows the cardinal directions: North, South, East and West, and it helps guide explorers in the right direction. After discussing the compass rose and talking about what each letter on the compass stands for, the Learners got to make their own compass rose to take home and explore!

This week, our shoutout goes to Tristan! Tristan is a First-Year Primary Learner at The School House. He is a gentle and kind Learner to all his Educators and peers. His independence has truly shone since starting at The School House, and it is clear that he thrives on exploring new activities and immersing himself in learning. Above, he is pictured using our Pink Tower activity and our Color Sorting Activity. Keep up the great work Tristan! It is such a joy having him in Primary I!

 **Looking Ahead**

-   We are so excited to send this year's School Care sign-ups to you. Each week between Monday - Thursday, a small group of Learners work around the school to do our School Care program. The group will do things like cooking, caring for the hens, tending to our garden or Food on Mars grow system, and completing various tasks around the building that need to be done each week. It is an exciting privilege and the Learners all look forward to it being their turn to take part in caring for the school. Below is the link for School Care sign ups!
