**Dear Primary I Parents,**

Happy Friday! We had a wonderful first full week with all of our PI Learners in attendance! It was amazing to observe our first year Pre-K Learners settling into Primary I with the guidance and support of our Kindergartners!  As role models for our younger Learners, they are taking time to demonstrate how to care for each other and our classroom. In turn, the Kindergartners are learning valuable lessons about responsibility and leadership , which helps to create a positive Learning Environment for everyone!

This week, we expanded on the idea of community.   As we grow, we become members of the circles of different communities around us.  We initiated this lesson by focusing on each one of us as an individual person. We were excited to read the book, Marvelous Me, by Lisa Bullard. This story introduces a boy named Alex who likens himself to a superhero. It celebrates the ways that Alex is uniquely himself…from his special smile to his grizzly hugs…and it encourages every child to embrace the superhero inside of them! To further develop this concept, we discussed that no matter how similar two people might be, each person is unique and that there are no two people  exactly the same.  We invited several Learners to look in a mirror and describe what they observed about themselves. Skylar shared that she had long, dark hair with hazel-brown eyes.  Tristan shared that he had short, light colored hair with blue eyes.  We then asked the Learners to share something special about themselves, whether it be their favorite color, activity or food.  We learned that Skylar loves to garden, Sully loves pizza, Jayson loves carrots and Noah and Owen both like the color green.  To encourage their creativity and to make a connection to nature, a self- portrait was made using natural materials.  We were in awe of the beautiful pieces that the Learners created!

Owen, Skylar and Maggie and Zachary work on their self-portraits.

Building upon the  theme of us each being a unique person, we moved on to our family unit.  This is a child’s very first community and each family home is also unique.  Families can be big or small,have parents, siblings and pets.  Others might have grandparents, aunts or uncles living  together.  The Learners took turns sharing their family communities and how these family members work together for the benefit of everyone. Collins shared that her family includes her Mom and Dad, her new brother and her dog Lola.  Owen shared that his family  included his Mom and Dad, his brother and his Grandmother.  James was excited to tell us that not only did he have a Mom and Dad, a brother and sister, but also lots of rabbits and frogs!   When asked “why are families important?” The Learners number one answer was that their families keep them safe! The Learners enjoyed sharing their family communities with each other and learning that every family is unique in its own way!

Our next lesson broadened our community circle.  We introduced our school community.  Primary I, in previous lessons, discussed the importance of our classroom community but, TSH expands beyond our Learning Environment!  How does our school community function?  Who is there in  addition to the Educators of TSH to provide a safe, clean building  for us?  We read the book, Our School is a Family, by Shannon Olsen.  This story beautifully shared all the different people that assist in making a school function seamlessly day in and day out.  It mentioned many important people that also work in our building to guide us all throughout the day.  This includes our school’s Founder, our Principal, our Educators, our HQ team, our Workshop Leaders, as well as our Nurse and Groundskeeper.  The Learners then worked together to make a collage featuring everyone that is part of The School House Team.  This gave them a visual representation of our school community working together.

Collins, Tristan, John and Quinn add to our TSH community collage.

We added one more circle to our collection of growing communities that we all belong to…this one being the community of America!  Each community we have reviewed to this point increases in the number of its members.  It starts with one…yourself, then it expands to your family, your school, your town, your state and then America…your country.  All these communities work together  successively to support one another.  We asked, “how can we be good citizens in the community of America?”  Riley said that we have to be kind and follow the rules, otherwise there will be consequences.  Leo said that we should help others and respect the flag. We also touched on the subject of voting…that it’s every citizen’s right to vote. We also talked about reciting the pledge every morning, making a promise to take care of our country.  We shared the story of Betsy Ross.  Many years ago, she was asked to make a flag to represent the community of America.  The flag she crafted had 13 stripes to represent the original 13 colonies.  As our country expanded, the number of stars increased, currently at 50, to represent all the state communities that are part of America.  The American flag is truly a symbol of how our country’s communities are all woven together.  To that end, our Learners helped to create our own classroom flag made out of beautiful squares of red, white and blue.

Noah and Benjamin took turns adding pieces to our flag.

To conclude our week of exploring the different communities that we all belong to, we presented the Learners with true/false questions as well as  “Who Am I” questions.  The Learners did fantastic recalling all the information that we discussed this week.

This week, we are so happy to feature Manas.  Manas is a proud PI Kindergarten Learner and is excited to serve as a mentor to our younger Learners.  He has shown an eagerness to return to his favorite math and language activities and is always dedicated to doing his best work. This inspires other Learners to challenge themselves with new activities.  This is sure to be a wonderful Kindergarten year for Manas!

 **Looking Ahead**

Next week, we will introduce the world’s greatest explorers from England, Ireland, Greece and America. We’ll discuss the interesting methods they used to navigate the world!
