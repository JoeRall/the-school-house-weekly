**Dear Primary I Parents,**

Happy Friday! We had such an incredible first week in Primary I with our Kindergarten Learners. We spent time getting to know each other, exploring everything on the shelves, and focusing on our classroom community.

The Kindergarteners entered the classroom on Wednesday so eager to get their hands on materials and immerse themselves in work. It was so lovely for us to see how happy and excited the Learners were to resume work with some of their favorite materials as well as receive new lessons. Our morning began with a book called A Letter from Your Teacher: On the First Day of School, by Shannon Olsen. This book provides beautiful guidelines for how we treat each other and our classroom with kindness and respect. We talked about how sometimes certain things may feel challenging, but that’s ok! Challenging ourselves is how we learn and grow, and we reminded Learners that we are here to help them. After the book, we had a conversation about how special it is that this week was only for Kindergarten Learners, and that they are our new Kindergarten Team! We made a big deal out of this because they are now the oldest role models in our classroom community and will help the younger Learners understand how to take care of our classroom. They were so excited about this and felt very important. Finally, we ended our morning Circle by having Learners participate in a fun challenge…a classroom scavenger hunt! Each Learner was equipped with a clipboard, pencil, and scavenger hunt as they raced around the room to find things like the rugs, the clock, the spill towels, the pencils, and more. It was the perfect way to get acquainted with the classroom and where our important materials are kept.

This week, we also spent a good portion of our time reviewing many of our Grace and Courtesy skills that many Learners are already familiar with. These include lessons like how to carry a chair, how to walk around someone’s work, how to get an Educator’s attention without interrupting, how to wash our hands, and so much more.

We spent a great deal of our time this week talking about how we are a “Kindergarten Team.” To begin our morning lesson, we read the book A Little Spot of Teamwork by Diane Alber. As we read, we posed the question, “What is a team?” Skylar raised her hand to answer “A group of people who work together!” The book helped us define words like “collaboration” and “communication.” We talked about how important it is for teams to communicate with each other and encourage one another. We also gave examples of how we might encourage each other by saying things like, “I love how you did that!” or “You worked so hard on that!” Next, to put our teamwork and communication skills into practice, we began a Cooperative Puzzle Challenge. We all gathered in a small circle and each Learner received one piece of a puzzle. Learners were asked to communicate with each other in order to solve the puzzle together. As we worked, Educators gave the Learners examples of how they might communicate. Instead of saying things like “No that’s not right!” we tried phrases like “What if you tried it this way?” and “What if you turned your puzzle piece?” We also practiced offering each other help and asking friends for help when we got stuck. Altogether, we completed 6 puzzles, and it was so wonderful to see the Learner’s communication skills increasing as we worked.

Once we had a better understanding of the word “team” and how teams successfully work together, we talked about how our Kindergarten Team this year are our big role models of the classroom. The younger Learners will look up to them and be excited to learn from them, so we reviewed many different ways that we can model taking care of each other and our classroom. We introduced the topic of our classroom being a “community,” which we will dive even deeper into next week. One facet of community we discussed was that a community is very similar to a team, where everyone works together and often has different strengths and/or roles. An important part of being in a community is “community care,” where we all participate in jobs to keep our classroom looking peaceful, clean, and beautiful. Learners were asked what they thought our classroom jobs should be this year, and were given time to ponder what the needs of our room are. Together, we decided we should have someone who checks that the rugs are rolled beautifully, someone who straightens and tidies the materials on our shelves, someone who dusts to keep shelves looking shiny, someone who cleans our tables each day, and so much more. As we continue next week, we will solidify our classroom jobs and create illustrations to represent how we will be caring for our classroom community daily.

Our week ended with a further exploration of community by reading The Story of Community by Mimosa Jones Tunney. This was the perfect introduction for us to begin talking about how a community successfully functions. After the story, we discussed the 7 ingredients for a strong community. One by one we went over each ingredient and added it to our “Community Recipe.” Our 7 ingredients went as follows: A community needs people with different strengths, leaders, or role models, the energy of teamwork, strong communication, kindness to each other, challenges to help us grow, and lastly - fun and celebration of successes. Finally, we baked “Community Bread,” (or Banana Bread) together as a class and each ingredient of the recipe represented one of these important elements of community. It was the perfect way to end such a special week!

This week, we are so happy to feature Skylar in the spotlight. Skylar’s warm energy can be felt the second she walks in the door in the morning. She greets her Educators and friends with a bright smile and a sweet “good morning!” Skylar puts her lunch box and water bottle away and gets right to work! She has been very interested in exploring some of our new Practical Life work, and has also been taking out some of her favorite activities to practice from last year. Skylar was eager to work with the Teen Beads this week, where she is practicing the concept that a teen number is made up of 10 and another number between 1 and 9. She is building these numbers in both a concrete way, with beads, and a symbolic way, with numbers. This gives Skylar a well rounded understanding of teen numbers. Above, Skylar can be seen enjoying our Coffee Grinding work, which is a fantastic exercise in hand strength. Skylar also emerged as a communication leader during our Collaboration Puzzle Activity. She used encouraging words to help guide her friends towards completing the puzzle, letting others figure out where their pieces fit but offering gentle suggestions and help if they needed it.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week, we will be diving deep into our Classroom Community. We are so excited to welcome the rest of our Primary I Learners!

**Questions to Ask & Parent Conversations**
