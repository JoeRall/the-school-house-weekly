**Dear TSH Families**,

**Dear TSH Families,**

It has been such an incredibly musical week together! I am so excited to continue working with our Learners. They have displayed a wonderful love of all things music, and I am so grateful that I get to expand on their knowledge with them.

In Primary, we worked on steady beat vs rhythm! Learners were able to tell the difference between the two by repeating the phrase "steady beat stays the same, rhythm always changes." We learned about how rhythm is made up of long and short sounds. The quarter note `(ta)` is equal to one steady beat, whereas our pair of eighth notes `(ti ti)` each equal half of one steady beat. Learners put this knowledge into action by working on a fall rhythm activity. We used the word "tree" to equal a quarter note, and "apple" to equal our eighth notes. Learners composed their own combination of these notes to create their very own fall rhythm, which we presented to the class! With our half-day Primary Learners, we took it a step further and added high and low pitches to our rhythms, creating our own class song. The Learners named this song "Top."

In Elementary I, we did a review of reading notes on the treble clef, to call upon their previous music knowledge. Learners used mnemonic devices such as "**E**very **G**ood **B**oy **D**oes **F**ine" to remember our line notes, and "when I see a space, I think of my **FACE**" to remember our space notes. We were able to use deductive reasoning to identify notes on the treble clef staff, which we then also used to decode some words written in music!

In Elementary II, we did a review of reading the treble clef, then moved onto rhythm work. We reviewed note values and experimented with some rhythm combinations. Each Learner then received a rhythm card, with a mix of quarter notes, eighth notes, half notes, and quarter rests written on it. In a circle, we kept a steady beat on a drum while we went one by one, reciting our rhythms. The Learner would say their rhythm, then the class would repeat. Learners did an excellent job with their rhythms, but also displayed amazing camaraderie when helping each other with more difficult rhythms. We ended our class with our new weekly tradition of "talent spotlight." Last week, a few Learners had expressed to me that they play outside instruments and would love to be able to perform in class. During the last couple minutes of our time together, Learners showcased their wonderful musical talents!

## In The Spotlight

<Image src={img7} />

This week, I would like to feature Elementary II Learner, Sibel! Sibel has been so enthusiastic about music, and it inspires me. Even at recess, she will come up to me, inquiring about what the next music lesson will be. She plays multiple instruments, and has shown interest in showcasing those instruments to the class! This week, she asked me if she could bring in a piano piece that she had been working on, and we were so delighted to hear her play. She performed "Fur Elise" by Beethoven, which sounded absolutely beautiful. Keep on playing, Sibel!

**Looking Ahead**

Next week with our Elementary Learners, we will be talking about song form and American Jazz. With our Primary Learners, we will be talking about our different types of voices- whisper, speaking, singing, and shouting.

**Questions to Ask & Parent Conversations**

-   What sayings do we use to remember the lines and spaces of the treble clef?
-   What song makes you feel happy?
-   Try this: Play some songs together, and tap the steady beat! (Hint: it never changes.)

All the best,

Ms. Gabby

Music Educator
