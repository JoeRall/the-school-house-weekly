**Dear TSH Families and Friends,**

Happy Friday!

**Science:**

It feels so good to be back and to see the Learners smile again!

In Science, this week we focused on one molecule that is going to be the center of our next physics experiments. The Learners were invited to guess what this molecule is using a few hints.. It is a vital component of all living organisms, it is the most common substance on Earth and is the only natural substance that can exist in all three states of matter (solid, liquid, and gas) at temperatures found on Earth. At this point many Learners had raised their hands. The molecule we are going to work with is WATER!

A water molecule `(H₂O)` consists of two hydrogen `(H)` atoms and one oxygen `(O)` atom. The molecule has a bent shape due to the angles between the hydrogen atoms. This is because of how the atoms bond and the electron arrangement around the oxygen atom.

Afterwards, we worked on three different experiments, each of which described different characteristics of this wonderful molecule.

For the first experiment, we used a “mysterious” powder and a bowl of water. We observed that the powder, when immersed in water, didn’t get wet. It was so interesting to discover that no matter how many times we dipped a spoonful of powder in the bowl, it would always come out as dry as before. After touching and smelling the powder, the Learners discovered that it was cocoa powder! We wondered why cocoa has such interesting properties and we learned that it is because cocoa powder contains fats (cocoa butter) and other compounds that are hydrophobic, meaning they don't mix well with water. Water molecules prefer to stay together rather than interact with the cocoa particles. Another example of hydrophobic substances are oil and wax.

Before introducing the second experiment, I asked the Learners if they ever tried to pour water from one cup to another? Of course many did, and they all shared that often, when they try to do it, the water tends to run down the sides of the cup. We wondered why this happens? Water runs down the side of a cup when poured slowly due to the cohesive and adhesive properties of water. Cohesion is the tendency of water molecules to stick to one another. As water flows out of the cup, the cohesive forces between the water molecules create surface tension, which causes the water to cling together in a stream rather than falling straight down. Adhesion is the tendency of water molecules to stick to other surfaces, like the cup's rim. As the water flows out, the adhesive forces between the water and the cup's surface cause the water to adhere to and run down the side of the cup instead of falling directly downward. The combination of cohesion and adhesion leads to the water "clinging" to the cup's surface rather than falling straight down. This is especially noticeable when pouring slowly, as the slower flow rate allows more time for the cohesive and adhesive forces to have an effect. At this point, I showed the Learners a way to transfer water from a cup to another one positioned far away, without spilling it: I attached a string to the two cups. On a cup full of water, it was attached to the backside with a piece of tape. On the other (empty) cup, it was attached to the front outside. I then lifted the cup full of water very carefully and the water started to travel on the string and slowly fell into the empty cup! How did this happen? When I lifted the cup, the water molecules in the full cup started to move up the string, pulling along the rest of the water due to the cohesive force. As the water molecules reached the string, they clung to it because of the adhesive force. This allowed the water to travel along the string instead of just falling straight down.

Last but not least, we moved to a third experiment. For this experiment the Learners were so excited to find out that we were going to use a water balloon! I asked the Learners if they thought the balloon would rip if poked with a push pin? Many said yes and, to nobody’s surprise, when we actually poked it, it ripped and splashed water everywhere, causing a chaotic, turbulent flow. I then used electrical tape to form a hashtag shape around a small area of a new water balloon and then  I carefully poked a small hole in the center of the taped area with a push pin. Surprisingly, this time the water flew out in a smooth, undisturbed stream. This experiment showed the laminar flow, another interesting property of water, which refers to a smooth orderly movement of fluid in parallel layers, with minimal disruption between them. In this type of flow, the velocity of the fluid is consistent, and the movement is streamlined.

**Coding:**

The Learners were so eager to get back to work on their codes! Same as with the Science Workshop, we took time to discuss our expectations for the year. As much as the Learners enjoy work on Scratch, a fun and educational coding program designed for kids which allows the Learners to create their own interactive stories, games, and animations using a visual programming language, the focus of this year will be the Grow Room. Together, by utilizing a Raspberry Pi, we’ll create a highly automated and responsive hydroponic garden system that not only enhances plant growth but also makes gardening more efficient and enjoyable.

**Memorable Moments:**

The Learners had a chance to observe the mysterious powder of the first experiment.

Olivia and Preston volunteered to poke a water balloon to observe the laminar flow.

**In the Spotlight**

The spotlight this week belongs to Dylan Arredondo. Dylan was so excited to get back to our Science Workshop and to help with one of our experiments. His enthusiasm is contagious and his questions inspire a sense of  wonder to all our workshops.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week, in Science we'll explore how liquids behave in connected containers and discover why they always level out to the same height, regardless of the shape or size of the vessels.

In Coding, The Learners will begin to work on a software that can capture plant health.

**Questions to Ask & Parent Conversations**

Some questions to ask Learners at the dinner table, during the course of next week:

-   What does Hydrophobic mean?
-   Why does water alway run down the side of a cup when pouring it?
-   What is the laminar flow?

 Have a wonderful Weekend!

**Warmly,**
